# Memory-Centric Architecture for Jarvis

## Rethinking Our Approach

The Rule of Five provides a clean organizational structure, but it may not address Jarvis's most fundamental requirement: a unified memory system that spans across projects and maintains context over time. This document proposes a memory-centric architecture that makes the memory system the core around which everything else is organized.

## Memory as the Core

In a memory-centric architecture, Jarvis's memory system is the foundation that enables:

1. **Context Preservation**: Maintaining understanding between sessions
2. **Cross-Project Knowledge**: Sharing insights and learning across projects
3. **Progressive Intelligence**: Building on past experiences
4. **User Adaptation**: Remembering user preferences and patterns

## Proposed Memory-Centric Structure

```

## Memory Integration Across Projects

The key difference in this architecture is how projects interact with memory:

1. **Memory-First Initialization**:
   ```js
   // Initialize a project with memory context
   const projectContext = Jarvis.memory.createProjectContext('todolist-agent');
   ```

2. **Shared Memory Access**:
   ```js
   // Access project-specific memory
   const todoPreferences = await Jarvis.memory.semantic.projects['todolist-agent'].get('user_preferences');
   
   // Access shared knowledge
   const bestPractices = await Jarvis.memory.semantic.knowledge_base.get('todo_best_practices');
   ```

3. **Cross-Project Learning**:
   ```js
   // Apply insights from one project to another
   const uiPatterns = await Jarvis.memory.procedural.projects['videogen'].get('ui_patterns');
   await Jarvis.memory.procedural.projects['todolist-agent'].apply(uiPatterns);
   ```

## Memory Types and Their Purpose

### Episodic Memory
Stores specific experiences and interactions:
- Conversation history with timestamps
- User commands and Jarvis responses
- Events and outcomes from specific sessions

### Semantic Memory
Stores factual knowledge and concepts:
- Project documentation and specifications
- User preferences and settings
- Technical knowledge and domain-specific information
- Best practices and guidelines

### Procedural Memory
Stores skills and processes:
- How to perform specific tasks
- Workflows for common operations
- Problem-solving approaches
- Coding patterns and techniques

## Project Integration with Memory

In this architecture, projects are defined by their memory footprint:

```json
{
  "id": "todolist-agent",
  "name": "Todo List Agent",
  "memory": {
    "episodic": {
      "retention_period": "90 days",
      "priority_tags": ["user_instruction", "error", "success"]
    },
    "semantic": {
      "knowledge_domains": ["react", "todo_management", "productivity"],
      "shared_access": ["ui_components", "best_practices"]
    },
    "procedural": {
      "skill_sets": ["component_creation", "state_management", "api_integration"]
    }
  }
}
```

## How This Addresses Our Current Needs

1. **Unified Context**: Jarvis maintains context across multiple projects
2. **Progressive Learning**: Lessons from one project benefit others
3. **Consistent Interface**: Memory provides a unified way to store and retrieve information
4. **Scalability**: Adding new projects means extending the memory footprint
5. **Flexibility**: Different memory types support different needs (short-term, long-term, procedural)

## Migration Path

To migrate to this memory-centric architecture:

1. **Map Current Memory**: Identify existing memory artifacts
2. **Create Memory Infrastructure**: Set up the memory structure
3. **Memory Population**: Move existing context into the memory system
4. **Memory API**: Create standardized APIs for memory access
5. **Project Integration**: Connect projects to the memory system
6. **Memory Optimization**: Tune memory retrieval and maintenance

## Advantages Over Rule of Five

1. **Cognitive Model Alignment**: Better reflects how an AI assistant should "think"
2. **Context Preservation**: Stronger focus on maintaining context between sessions
3. **Cross-Project Intelligence**: Better supports learning across different projects
4. **Adaptive Intelligence**: Framework for Jarvis to improve over time
5. **User-Centric**: Organizes around user interactions rather than code structure

## Next Steps

1. Prototype the memory system core
2. Create memory APIs for the todolist-agent
3. Test context preservation across sessions
4. Implement the first version of cross-project memory
5. Document the memory interaction patterns
