# Managing Multiple Projects in the Jarvis Structure

## Single IDE Workflow

The new Jarvis directory structure is specifically designed to support managing and running multiple projects from a single IDE instance (like Cursor) with several benefits:

### Directory Organization

```
/Jarvis
├── core/                  # Shared Jarvis capabilities
├── tools/                 # Shared utility tools
├── workspace/             # Shared planning documents
├── projects/              # All projects live here
│   ├── todolist-agent/    # Project 1
│   ├── videogen/          # Project 2
│   └── other-projects/    # Additional projects
└── docs/                  # Shared documentation
```

## Benefits of Consolidated Project Management

1. **Unified Code Management**: All projects accessible from a single IDE workspace
2. **Shared Tooling**: Projects can leverage the same Jarvis core tools
3. **Consistent Environment**: Similar configuration and setup across projects
4. **Simplified Navigation**: Easily navigate between related project files
5. **Reduced Resource Usage**: Only one IDE instance needed instead of multiple

## Multi-Terminal Workflow

Running multiple projects simultaneously is straightforward:

1. Open Cursor with the root Jarvis directory as your workspace
2. Open multiple terminal instances within Cursor
3. Navigate each terminal to a different project directory
4. Run each project independently in its respective terminal

Example terminal commands:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Run todolist-agent
cd Jarvis/projects/todolist-agent
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Run videogen backend
cd Jarvis/projects/videogen/backend
npm run start

# Terminal 3: Run videogen frontend
cd Jarvis/projects/videogen/frontend
npm run dev
```

## Project Switching

Quick switching between projects is enhanced by having them in a consistent structure:

1. Use the file explorer to navigate between projects
2. Create workspace bookmarks for frequently accessed project directories
3. Use search functionality to find files across all projects
4. Use keyboard shortcuts to switch between terminal instances

## Environment Management

Projects can maintain their own environment files while sharing common configuration:

```
/Jarvis/projects/todolist-agent/.env.local  # Project-specific environment
/Jarvis/projects/videogen/.env.local        # Project-specific environment 
/Jarvis/core/config/shared.env              # Shared environment variables
```

## Resource Management

This approach helps efficiently manage resources:

1. **Memory**: Consolidated IDE instance uses less RAM than multiple instances
2. **Context**: Better context preservation when switching between projects
3. **Cognitive Load**: Consistent structure reduces mental overhead

## Setting Up This Workflow

1. Clone or set up Jarvis repository with the new structure
2. Place or clone all your projects into the `/Jarvis/projects/` directory
3. Configure each project to work in its own directory
4. Open Cursor with the Jarvis root directory as your workspace
5. Use multiple terminal windows to run different projects simultaneously

This approach provides the best of both worlds: independent projects with clear boundaries, while still allowing for unified management and efficient resource usage.
