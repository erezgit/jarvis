# Product Requirements Document: Time Tracking Synchronization Fix

## Problem Statement
There is a synchronization issue between the frontend and backend time tracking systems. When a user starts a chat session with an advisor, the frontend timer starts immediately, but the backend timer starts with a significant delay. This causes the frontend timer to jump back when it synchronizes with the backend, leading to a confusing user experience.

Specifically:
1. The frontend timer starts at page load and increments every second
2. At around 15 seconds, the frontend polls for an update but the backend hasn't started timing yet
3. At around 30 seconds, the frontend polls again and receives 15 seconds from the backend
4. The frontend resets to match the backend time (15 seconds), causing a visible jump backwards

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Ensure the backend timer starts immediately when a new time tracking record is created
2. Eliminate the time gap between database record creation and timer initialization
3. Maintain synchronization between frontend and backend timers from the beginning of a session
4. Preserve all existing time tracking functionality and credit deduction mechanisms

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Minimize user-visible timer jumps or inconsistencies
2. Maintain performance - the solution should not add significant overhead
3. Ensure backward compatibility with existing time tracking records
4. Update logging to clearly indicate timer initialization status

## Success Criteria
1. When a new chat session starts, the backend timer starts within 1 second of the frontend timer
2. No visible jumps in the timer display during normal usage
3. Time tracking data remains accurate for billing and credit deduction
4. No regression in existing time tracking functionality

## Out of Scope
1. Comprehensive redesign of the time tracking system
2. Changes to the credit deduction logic or rates
3. Changes to the frontend polling frequency or display mechanisms
