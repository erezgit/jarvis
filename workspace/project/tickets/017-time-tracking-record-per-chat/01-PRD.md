# Product Requirements Document: Time Tracking Record Per Chat

## Overview
This ticket addresses a critical architectural mismatch in the time tracking system. Currently, the system maintains one active record per user-advisor pair and updates this record when the user switches to a new chat with the same advisor. However, query mechanisms in the codebase expect each chat to have its own dedicated time tracking record. This mismatch causes errors when attempting to retrieve time tracking data for previous chats.

## Problem Statement
When a user starts multiple chats with the same advisor, the system:
1. Creates or updates a single time tracking record for the user-advisor pair
2. Updates this record to point to the most recent chat
3. Attempts to query for time tracking data using chat-specific queries
4. Fails with "No active time tracking record found" errors for previous chats

This leads to:
- Error messages displayed to users
- Inaccurate time tracking display
- Failed API requests
- Potential confusion in the user experience

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Record Creation**: Each chat should have its own dedicated time tracking record, maintaining a 1:1 relationship between chats and records.
2. **Credit Tracking**: All credit calculations and deductions should work correctly across multiple simultaneous chats with the same advisor.
3. **Time Accuracy**: Chat duration should be tracked accurately for each chat independently.
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing time tracking records should be handled appropriately to prevent data loss.
5. **Error Handling**: The system should handle edge cases gracefully, including when a chat has no associated record.

### Technical Requirements
1. **Architecture Alignment**: Update the record management logic to align with record access patterns.
2. **Migration Strategy**: Develop a plan for handling existing records during the transition.
3. **Code Consistency**: Ensure all related functions maintain consistent behavior.
4. **Performance**: The solution should not introduce significant performance overhead.
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing to ensure the solution works across various user scenarios.

## Success Metrics
1. Zero "No active time tracking record found" errors in production logs
2. Accurate time tracking data displayed for all active chats
3. Proper credit deduction when using multiple chats with the same advisor
4. Positive user feedback on time tracking reliability

## User Experience
The primary goal is to eliminate user-facing errors and ensure that time tracking information is always available and accurate. Users should be able to:
- Switch between chats with the same advisor without tracking errors
- See correct time and credit usage for each chat
- Experience no visible difference in the interface other than improved reliability

## Dependencies
- Time tracking API endpoints
- Database schema for conversation time records
- Credit deduction system
- Frontend components that display time tracking information

## Constraints
- Minimal disruption to existing user sessions during deployment
- Backward compatibility with existing database records
- Adherence to the current credit tracking model

## Timeline
This should be addressed with high priority, as it affects core functionality and user experience.
