# Token System Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. TokenRepository Improvements

We've made significant improvements to the `TokenRepository` class:

1. **Removed Database Transactions**:
   - Removed the transaction-based approach which was causing issues
   - Implemented individual operations with better error handling
   - This ensures that token balance updates succeed even if transaction recording fails

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added detailed error logging for all database operations
   - Included error codes, messages, and stack traces in logs
   - Properly handled type conversion for balance values

3. **Added Duplicate Prevention**:
   - Added a check for existing transactions with the same payment ID
   - This prevents duplicate token additions if the same payment is processed multiple times

4. **Improved Logging**:
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the repository
   - Each operation now logs its inputs, outputs, and any errors
   - This will make debugging much easier in the future

### 2. PaymentService Retry Logic

We've added robust retry logic to the `PaymentService.capturePayment` method:

1. **Multiple Retry Attempts**:
   - Implemented a retry mechanism with up to 3 attempts
   - Added exponential backoff between retries (1s, 2s, 4s)

2. **Error Tracking**:
   - Tracked the last error for better diagnostics
   - Updated payment status to FAILED if all retries fail

3. **Detailed Logging**:
   - Added logging for each retry attempt
   - Included comprehensive error information in logs

### 3. Database Cleanup

Created a SQL script to clean up old pending payments:

```sql
-- Update old pending payments to FAILED status
UPDATE public.payments
SET status = 'FAILED', 
    updated_at = NOW(),
    metadata = jsonb_build_object('error', 'Payment timed out')
WHERE status = 'PENDING' 
AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of the "Unknown error" when adding tokens was:

1. **Transaction Handling**: The previous implementation used database transactions, which were failing silently
2. **Error Propagation**: Errors in the token transaction recording were causing the entire operation to fail
3. **Insufficient Logging**: The error details weren't being properly logged

## Expected Results

With these changes, the token system should now:

1. **Work Reliably**: Token balance updates should succeed even if transaction recording has issues
2. **Provide Better Diagnostics**: Detailed logs will make troubleshooting easier
3. **Handle Transient Errors**: The retry logic will handle temporary database issues
4. **Prevent Duplicates**: The system will handle duplicate payment processing gracefully

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fix:

1. **Test Complete Flow**: Process a payment from start to finish
2. **Check Database**: Verify that token balance is updated and transaction is recorded
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check for any errors or warnings in the logs
4. **Test Edge Cases**:
   - Test with a new user who doesn't have a token balance yet
   - Test with an existing user who already has tokens
   - Test processing the same payment twice (should be idempotent)

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Production**: Watch for any errors in the production logs
2. **Consider Additional Improvements**:
   - Add more comprehensive metrics and monitoring
   - Implement a notification system for failed token additions
   - Consider adding a background job to retry failed token additions
