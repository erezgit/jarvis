# Payment Service Architecture Alignment Summary

## Overview

We've successfully aligned the `PaymentService` with our service architecture standards. This involved fixing class structure issues, improving API client integration, reorganizing hooks, and enhancing error handling.

## Key Changes

### 1. Fixed Class Structure

- Created an `ApiClientAdapter` to wrap the `UnifiedApiClient` and match the `BaseService`'s API interface
- Fixed the issue of `PaymentService` trying to override the read-only `api` property
- Implemented missing interface methods required by `IPaymentService`
- Added utility methods for error handling, response validation, and retry logic

### 2. Improved API Client Integration

- Updated all methods to use the API client correctly
- Standardized API request patterns across all methods
- Added comprehensive response validation
- Fixed URL construction for backend API requests

### 3. Reorganized Hooks

- Created a proper hooks directory within the service (`src/core/services/payment/hooks/`)
- Moved hooks from `src/core/hooks/tokens/` to the correct location
- Created an index file to export all hooks
- Updated hook implementations to use the singleton `paymentService` export

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

- Standardized error handling across all methods
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors
- Improved error messages with more context
- Added error tracking and metrics

### 5. Added Type Declarations

- Added type declarations for `window.errorTracker` and `window.metrics`
- Created interfaces for `ErrorTracker` and `Metrics`

## Next Steps

1. Update imports in components that use the hooks
2. Add unit tests for the service and hooks
3. Update documentation

## Conclusion

The `PaymentService` now follows our service architecture standards, with proper class structure, API client integration, hook organization, and error handling. This will make the service more maintainable, testable, and consistent with the rest of the codebase.
