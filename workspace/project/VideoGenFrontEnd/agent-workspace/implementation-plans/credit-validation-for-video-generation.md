## Success Criteria
- âœ… Users cannot generate videos without sufficient credits
- âœ… Clear error messages when credits are insufficient 
- âœ… Easy navigation to purchase more credits
- âœ… Smooth user experience protecting service resources

## Implementation Plan

## ðŸ”µ Phase 1: Core Functionality

- âœ… Update the `useVideoGeneration` hook to detect insufficient credits
- âœ… Add an `onInsufficientCredits` callback to redirect users
- âœ… Modify the `VideoGeneration` and `VideoUploader` components to use the callback
- âœ… Test error handling for credit-related errors

## ðŸ”µ Phase 2: Frontend UI Enhancement

- âœ… Add credit validation in `NewVideo` component

- âœ… Modify the NewVideo page to use a modal approach instead of an inline alert
- âœ… Ensure the modal only appears when the "Generate Video" button is clicked
- âœ… Remove the inline credit validation warning from the UI

## ðŸ”µ Phase 4: Backend Coordination

- âœ… Ensure backend API properly validates credit balance
- âœ… Return appropriate error codes for insufficient credits
- âœ… Document API error responses for frontend development
- âœ… Test integration between frontend and backend components

## Summary of Implementation

The credit validation feature for video generation has been successfully implemented with the following enhancements:

1. **Core Error Handling**: Updated `useVideoGeneration` hook to detect "insufficient credits" errors and trigger appropriate callbacks
2. **UI Feedback**: Created a modal dialog showing insufficient credits error that appears only when user attempts to generate a video
3. **User Flow**: Implemented direct navigation to the Credits page for purchasing more credits
4. **Protection Logic**: Added validation checks to prevent video generation attempts when credits are insufficient
5. **Experience Improvement**: Removed intrusive inline alerts in favor of a contextual modal approach

This implementation ensures users have a smooth experience while effectively protecting the service from unauthorized video generation attempts when users don't have sufficient credits.
