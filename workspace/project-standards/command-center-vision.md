# Jarvis: Cursor Command Center Vision

## Core Concept
Transform Cursor from a development tool into Jarvis - a full command center for business operations, leveraging AI capabilities to create, manage, and execute workflows across multiple domains.

## Foundational Principles

1. **Persistent Knowledge Environment**
   - Agent workspace as the externalized memory structure
   - Documented procedures that evolve over time
   - Architecture standards that ensure consistency

2. **Human-AI Partnership**
   - Cursor as the interface to AI capabilities
   - Claude/AI as the reasoning engine
   - Scripts as execution capabilities

3. **Structured Knowledge Organization**
   - Project standards documents
   - Feature/ticket documentation system
   - Implementation plans with trackable progress

## Current Capabilities

- **Development**
  - Architecture planning
  - Feature implementation
  - Code generation and maintenance

- **Content Creation**
  - Image generation with DALL-E
  - Potentially social media posting
  - Document creation

## Expansion Strategy

1. **Tools Layer**
   - Create specialized Python scripts for specific capabilities
   - Each script follows command line interface pattern
   - Results saved directly to project directories

2. **Knowledge Layer**
   - Documentation for each capability
   - Procedures for complex workflows
   - Standards for consistency

3. **Workflow Layer**
   - Scripts that chain multiple capabilities
   - Tracking mechanisms
   - Feedback loops

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Tool Library**
   - Additional image manipulation tools
   - Data analysis capabilities
   - Content generation for various platforms

2. **Develop Workflow Documentation**
   - Create procedure templates
   - Document standard operating procedures
   - Build knowledge base of strategies

3. **Create Integration Points**
   - Methods to connect different tools
   - Ways to maintain context between tools
   - Standardized input/output formats

## Long-Term Vision

A complete command center where the human operator can direct AI capabilities across all business functions, with Cursor serving as both the development environment and the control panel for an ever-expanding set of AI capabilities.

The ultimate goal is to create a system where knowledge compounds, procedures refine, and capabilities expand over time, creating a truly adaptive business operating system.
