# Jarvis Presentation Image Prompts

These image prompts are designed according to our design standards document to create visually consistent and appealing images for the Jarvis presentation.

## 1. Modern Jarvis AI Assistant Interface

```
A sleek, modern AI assistant interface with deep blues (#1A2B63, #2E4172) and teal (#008F8C) color scheme. Minimalist design with clean lines and subtle geometric elements. The interface should have an asymmetrical layout with clear typography hierarchy using Sans-serif fonts like Poppins for headings and Inter for body text. Include monospace font (JetBrains Mono) for code snippets or technical specifications. The design should balance technical sophistication with approachable aesthetics, featuring ample whitespace and a magazine editorial style. Accent with vibrant blue (#0084FF) for key interactive elements.
```

## 2. Human-AI Collaboration Scene

```
A person collaborating with an AI assistant in a modern workspace. The scene should use the brand color palette with deep blues (#1A2B63, #2E4172), teals (#008F8C), and warm grays (#E6E6E6) with occasional orange (#FF6B35) accents. The composition should be asymmetrical but balanced, showing both human and AI perspectives. The human should be gesturing toward holographic or digital interfaces with clean typography. Show visual metaphors for the collaboration process with minimal line art illustrations. Include subtle grid patterns and technical elements that feel sophisticated without being alienating. The overall aesthetic should combine technical depth with practical, approachable design that tells the story of human-AI partnership.
```

## 3. Jarvis Architecture Diagram

```
A clean, detailed architecture diagram for the Jarvis AI assistant system. Use the brand color palette with deep blues (#1A2B63, #2E4172) for main components, teal (#008F8C) for connections, and subtle gray (#E6E6E6) for background elements. The diagram should illustrate the key components of the system: tools (operational code), workspace (planning and presentation), and memory system (persistent knowledge). Use consistent geometric shapes with rounded corners for each component. Include clear typography using Sans-serif fonts like Montserrat for component labels and monospace font for technical details. The layout should follow a modular grid system with ample whitespace. Add subtle directional flow indicators showing how components interact. The overall aesthetic should be modern, technical but highly readable with a clear visual hierarchy.
```

## 4. Jarvis AI Command Center

```
A sophisticated AI command center interface in a modern, editorial style. Use the brand color palette with deep blues (#1A2B63, #2E4172) as the primary colors, teal (#008F8C) for interactive elements, and warm grays (#E6E6E6) for secondary information. The layout should feature a modular grid system with clean information hierarchy. Include multiple screens or panels showing different Jarvis capabilities: code development, image generation, content creation, and information management. Add subtle data visualizations using vibrant blue (#0084FF) and orange (#FF6B35) accent colors. Incorporate minimal line art illustrations and geometric patterns that feel high-tech but approachable. Use Sans-serif typography (Poppins for headings, Inter for body text) with monospace elements (JetBrains Mono) for technical details. The overall aesthetic should balance magazine-inspired editorial design with functional, modern digital interfaces.
