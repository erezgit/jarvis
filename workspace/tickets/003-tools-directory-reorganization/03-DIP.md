# Tools Directory Reorganization - Detailed Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Analysis and Preparation

### Step 1: Current State Analysis
- ✅ Identify all current tools in the codebase
- ✅ Document their functionality, dependencies, and interfaces
- ✅ Map out current import relationships
- ✅ Identify potential challenges for reorganization

### Step 2: Preparation
- ✅ Create the new directory structure
- ✅ Set up `__init__.py` files for proper packaging
- ✅ Create placeholder files to validate imports

## Phase 2: Core Functionality Implementation

### Step 3: Extract Core Image Generation
- ✅ Create the `core/image_generation` module
- ✅ Extract core functionality from `generate_image.py` to `core/image_generation/generator.py`
- ✅ Ensure proper handling of environment variables and configuration
- ✅ Add comprehensive docstrings and type hints
- ✅ Test core functionality independently

### Step 4: Implement Other Core Modules (if any)
- ✅ Identify other tools that need core modules
- ✅ Follow same pattern as image generation for each

## Phase 3: CLI Interface Implementation

### Step 5: Create CLI for Image Generation
- ✅ Create `cli/generate_image.py` that imports from core
- ✅ Implement argparse for command-line arguments
- ✅ Add helpful usage information
- ✅ Ensure output formatting matches current behavior
- ✅ Make the script executable with proper entry points
- ✅ Test CLI functionality

### Step 6: Implement Other CLI Tools (if any)
- ✅ Identify other tools that need CLI interfaces
- ✅ Follow same pattern as image generation for each

## Phase 4: Framework Integration Implementation

### Step 7: CrewAI Integration for Image Generation
- ✅ Create `integrations/crewai/tools/image_tool.py`
- ✅ Implement CrewAI Tool wrapper around core functionality
- ✅ Ensure compatibility with existing CrewAI agent code
- ✅ Test with a sample CrewAI workflow

### Step 8: Other Framework Integrations (if any)
- ✅ Identify other framework integrations needed
- ✅ Follow same pattern as CrewAI for each

## Phase 5: Testing and Documentation

### Step 9: End-to-End Testing
- ✅ Test the image generation workflow from CLI
- ✅ Test the image generation workflow from CrewAI
- ✅ Compare results with the original implementation
- ✅ Fix any discrepancies or issues

### Step 10: Documentation
- ✅ Create documentation for the new structure
- ✅ Write usage guidelines for adding new tools
- ✅ Document the migration process for reference
- ✅ Update any existing documentation that references tools

## Phase 6: Migration and Cleanup

### Step 11: Update Import References
- ✅ Update all imports in the codebase to reference new structure
- ✅ Create adapters in old locations to maintain backward compatibility
- ✅ Test the entire application to ensure it still works

### Step 12: Cleanup
- ✅ Add deprecation warnings to old files
- ✅ Add clear documentation about the new structure
- ✅ Perform final verification that everything works as expected

## Implementation Schedule

| Phase | Estimated Timeframe | Dependencies |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| 1: Analysis and Preparation | 1 day | None |
| 2: Core Functionality | 1-2 days | Phase 1 |
| 3: CLI Interface | 1 day | Phase 2 |
| 4: Framework Integration | 1-2 days | Phase 2 |
| 5: Testing and Documentation | 2 days | Phases 3-4 |
| 6: Migration and Cleanup | 1 day | Phase 5 |

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during implementation, the following rollback steps should be taken:

1. Keep original files until the end of the migration
2. If problems occur, revert import changes to use original files
3. Document issues for future resolution

## Success Verification

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. ✅ All tools function correctly with the new structure
2. ✅ Both CLI and CrewAI integrations work without issues
3. ✅ All tests pass
4. ✅ Documentation is complete
5. ✅ No original functionality has been lost
