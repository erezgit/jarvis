# Ticket: Jarvis Standalone Application

## Overview
Create a standalone Next.js application for Jarvis to provide a dedicated interface with multiple pages for the memory architecture and assistant functionality.

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Background
Currently, Jarvis has a single page implementation within the TodoList project at `app/(public)/jarvis`. We want to evolve Jarvis beyond this single page into a fully-featured interface with multiple pages that can grow independently of the TodoList application.

### Goals
- Create a standalone Next.js application in the Jarvis directory
- Implement the memory architecture UI shown in the existing page
- Set up proper routing for a multi-page application
- Ensure clean separation from the TodoList project

### Non-Goals
- Duplicating all TodoList features
- Rebuilding complex authentication (simpler solution initially)
- Migrating existing data (can be addressed later)

### User Experience
- Users should be able to access the Jarvis interface through a dedicated URL
- The interface should include the memory architecture visualization
- Navigation should allow movement between different sections of Jarvis
- The UI should follow modern design principles with responsive layouts

### Technical Requirements
- Next.js application with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Proper file and component organization
- Clean, maintainable code structure

## Architectural Design Document (ADD)

### Project Structure
```
/Jarvis
  /app                       # Next.js App Router
    /api                     # API routes
    /(memory)                # Memory-related pages
      /episodic/page.tsx
      /semantic/page.tsx
      /procedural/page.tsx
      /index/page.tsx
    /layout.tsx              # Main layout with navigation
    /page.tsx                # Home page
  /components                # Reusable components
    /memory                  # Memory-specific components
    /ui                      # UI components
    /layout                  # Layout components
  /lib                       # Utility functions and shared code
  /public                    # Static assets
  /styles                    # Global styles
  next.config.js             # Next.js configuration
  package.json               # Dependencies
  tsconfig.json              # TypeScript configuration
  tailwind.config.js         # Tailwind configuration
```

### Technical Approach
1. Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
2. Set up the app router structure
3. Create the main layout with navigation
4. Implement the memory architecture components
5. Create the individual memory type pages
6. Add API routes for data interaction
7. Implement responsive design

### Dependencies
- Next.js 14+
- React 18+
- TypeScript 5+
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui (for UI components)

## Detailed Implementation Plan (DIP)

### Phase 1: Project Setup
1. Create a new Next.js project in the Jarvis directory
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest jarvis-app --typescript --tailwind --app
   ```
2. Set up the initial file structure
3. Configure Tailwind CSS
4. Add shadcn/ui components

### Phase 2: Core UI Implementation
1. Create the main layout with:
   - Header with navigation
   - Sidebar for memory types
   - Main content area
2. Implement the home page with memory architecture visualization
3. Create memory card components

### Phase 3: Memory Type Pages
1. Create individual pages for:
   - Episodic memory
   - Semantic memory
   - Procedural memory
   - Index memory
2. Implement the UI for each memory type
3. Add navigation between pages

### Phase 4: Functionality
1. Implement memory storage functionality
2. Add API routes for memory operations
3. Create utilities for memory management

### Phase 5: Refinement
1. Improve responsive design
2. Add animations and transitions
3. Implement dark/light mode
4. Optimize for performance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Standalone Next.js application is created and running
- [ ] Memory architecture UI is implemented
- [ ] Navigation between different pages works correctly
- [ ] Responsive design works on various screen sizes
- [ ] Code is well-structured and maintainable
- [ ] Application is completely independent from TodoList project

## Additional Notes
- Consider looking at the existing Jarvis page implementation for design reference
- Maintain consistent styling with the existing Jarvis aesthetic
- Document code for future maintainability
- Consider making components reusable for future expansion
