# Image Service API - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
The image generation service currently exists as a Python module but lacks a REST API endpoint for external access. This ticket addresses the need to create a REST API endpoint for the image generation service to allow other systems and applications to request image generation programmatically.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Create a REST API endpoint to expose the image generation service
2. The API should accept and validate parameters for image generation including:
   - Prompt text
   - Image size (width and height)
   - Number of images to generate
   - Additional generation parameters as needed
3. The API should return:
   - Generated image file(s) or URL(s) to access them
   - Success/failure status
   - Error messages when appropriate
4. Implement proper error handling for:
   - Invalid input parameters
   - Service unavailability
   - Generation failures
5. Ensure the API adheres to RESTful principles

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: The API should add minimal overhead to the image generation process
2. **Scalability**: Design should support future scaling of the service
3. **Security**: Implement appropriate authentication/authorization mechanisms
4. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive API documentation
5. **Testing**: Include unit and integration tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- The API endpoint successfully accepts requests and returns generated images
- All error conditions are properly handled and reported
- API documentation is complete and accurate
- Tests demonstrate the API works correctly under various conditions

## Dependencies
- Existing image generation service (`generate_image.py`)
- Web framework for API implementation (to be determined during architecture design)
