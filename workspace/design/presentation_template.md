# Jarvis Presentation Template

This template provides a structure for creating magazine-style presentations about Jarvis and its features. Follow these guidelines to maintain consistency across all Jarvis presentations.

## Cover Slide

```
# [PRESENTATION TITLE]
## [SUBTITLE OR TAGLINE]

[STRIKING HERO IMAGE]

[DATE]
```

**Design Notes:**
- Title: Poppins Bold, 36pt, #1A2B63
- Subtitle: Montserrat Medium, 24pt, #2E4172
- Image: Full-bleed background or large focal element following image generation guide
- Date: Inter Light, 16pt, #B2B2B2

## Introduction Slide

```
# About Jarvis

[CONCISE DESCRIPTION - 2-3 sentences maximum]

[SUPPORTING IMAGE - Command center or relevant feature visualization]
```

**Design Notes:**
- Keep text minimal - aim for under 50 words
- Image should occupy approximately 60% of slide space
- Consider split-screen layout with text left, image right

## Feature/Concept Slides

```
# [FEATURE NAME]

## Key Points
- [POINT 1]
- [POINT 2]
- [POINT 3]

[RELEVANT VISUALIZATION]
```

**Design Notes:**
- Limit to 3-4 key points per slide
- Use consistent bullet styling
- Visualization should directly support the points being made
- Consider "magazine sidebar" treatment for supplementary information

## Process/Flow Slides

```
# [PROCESS NAME]

[SIMPLIFIED DIAGRAM OR FLOW CHART]

1. [STEP ONE]
2. [STEP TWO]
3. [STEP THREE]
```

**Design Notes:**
- Use clean, minimal diagrams with Jarvis color palette
- Number steps clearly
- Consider subtle animation between steps (if format allows)
- Use consistent iconography for different process types

## Technical Specification Slides

```
# Technical Details

| Feature | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| [ITEM 1] | [SPEC 1]     |
| [ITEM 2] | [SPEC 2]     |
| [ITEM 3] | [SPEC 3]     |

[SUPPORTING TECHNICAL VISUALIZATION]
```

**Design Notes:**
- Use tables sparingly for technical specifications
- Consider progressive disclosure techniques for complex information
- Use monospace font (JetBrains Mono) for code or technical parameters
- Technical visualizations should be clean and focused

## Call-to-Action Slide

```
# Next Steps

## [PRIMARY ACTION]
[DESCRIPTION]

## [SECONDARY ACTIONS]
- [ACTION 1]
- [ACTION 2]

[MOTIVATIONAL OR FORWARD-LOOKING IMAGE]
```

**Design Notes:**
- Primary action should have visual emphasis (size, color, position)
- Use vibrant accent color (#0084FF) for primary action elements
- Image should convey progress, innovation, or potential

## Layout Principles

1. **Grid System**: Use a 12-column grid for flexible layouts
2. **White Space**: Maintain generous margins and padding
3. **Text Density**: Limit to 30-40 words per slide
4. **Image Ratio**: Aim for 60/40 visual-to-text ratio
5. **Consistent Headers**: Same position and styling across slides

## Typography Hierarchy

- **Slide Titles**: Poppins Bold, 32pt, #1A2B63
- **Section Headers**: Poppins Medium, 24pt, #2E4172
- **Body Text**: Inter Regular, 18pt, #333333
- **Captions/Notes**: Inter Light, 14pt, #666666
- **Code/Technical**: JetBrains Mono, 16pt, #008F8C

## Magazine-Inspired Elements

- **Pull Quotes**: For emphasizing key concepts (Inter Italic, 24pt)
- **Sidebars**: For supplementary information or examples
- **Full-Bleed Images**: For high-impact visual slides
- **Drop Caps**: For section introductions (where appropriate)
- **Columnar Text**: For longer explanatory content

This template should be adapted as needed while maintaining visual consistency with Jarvis design standards.
