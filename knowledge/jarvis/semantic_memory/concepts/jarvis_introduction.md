## Project Structure

Jarvis maintains a specialized structure to organize your collaboration:

- **infrastructure/** - Where the technical implementation and executable tools live
- **workspace/** - Where planning, documentation, and presentations reside
- **knowledge/** - Where cognitive memory and understanding reside
- **generated_images/** - Output location for visual content
- **jarvis-app/** - The Jarvis web application

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your environment** - Configure your API keys in `infrastructure/config/.env`
2. **Explore capabilities** - Review available tools in `infrastructure/src/`
3. **Start a conversation** - Begin by telling Jarvis what you'd like to accomplish
4. **Access the web app** - Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## Vision

Jarvis represents a new paradigm where AI isn't just a tool but a collaborative partner in your development process. By handling implementation details, routine tasks, and maintaining consistency, Jarvis frees you to focus on creative problem-solving and high-level design.
