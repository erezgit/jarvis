# Memory System Development Conversation

## Summary

This conversation focused on implementing the cognitive memory system for Jarvis, with emphasis on episodic memory's auto-capture functionality. We discussed the differences between conversations and sessions in episodic memory, and how to implement automatic saving without explicit user commands.

## Key Points Discussed

1. **Memory Types Clarification**
   - Differentiated between semantic, episodic, procedural, and structured memory
   - Established that episodic memory should have both conversations (detailed exchanges) and sessions (high-level summaries)

2. **Automatic Memory Capture**
   - Defined trigger conditions for auto-saving conversations
   - Established session boundaries and summarization procedures
   - Agreed episodic memory should be captured proactively without explicit commands

3. **Implementation Approach**
   - Decided to enhance the initialization procedure rather than create separate scripts
   - Added clear guidelines for what Jarvis should consider significant enough to save
   - Created metadata format for conversations and sessions

4. **Initialization Process**
   - Added logic to create initial episodic memory during first startup
   - Ensured episodic memory retrieval is part of context initialization

## Decisions Made

1. Jarvis will automatically save conversations based on significance triggers
2. Session summaries will be created at logical session boundaries
3. Episodic memory will be used to maintain context between interactions
4. The memory browser in the web app will provide direct access to all memory types

## Next Steps

1. Continue developing the memory system with actual usage
2. Create additional procedural workflows for memory management
3. Implement more sophisticated retrieval mechanisms for relevant memories
4. Test the auto-save functionality across multiple sessions

## Code/Systems Created

- Enhanced the initialization procedure with detailed episodic memory capabilities
- Created example conversation file structure with metadata
- Updated the web app's memory browser to access memory files directly
