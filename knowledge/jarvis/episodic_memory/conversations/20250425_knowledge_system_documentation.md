# Knowledge System Documentation Conversation

## Summary

This conversation focused on creating a comprehensive documentation page for Jarvis's knowledge system architecture. We developed a detailed visualization and description of the cognitive memory structure, including all four memory types (semantic, episodic, procedural, and structured) and their interactions.

## Key Points Discussed

1. **Documentation Request**
   - User requested creation of a new documentation page showing a diagram of Jarvis's knowledge system
   - Emphasized the need for comprehensive descriptions of memory components

2. **Implementation Approach**
   - Created a new Next.js page at `/docs/memory-knowledge-system/page.tsx`
   - Developed a visual diagram representing the four memory types with their subdirectories
   - Added detailed descriptions of each memory component's purpose and contents
   - Updated the main documentation page to link to the new knowledge system map

3. **Knowledge System Structure**
   - Documented the cognitive architecture with four memory systems:
     - Semantic Memory (concepts and relationships)
     - Episodic Memory (conversations and sessions)
     - Procedural Memory (workflows and templates)
     - Structured Memory (projects and entities)
   - Documented the directory structure mirroring this cognitive organization

4. **Memory Interactions**
   - Documented how the different memory systems interact and complement each other
   - Explained how cross-memory retrieval works to provide comprehensive responses

## Decisions Made

1. Use a visual diagram approach to illustrate the cognitive architecture
2. Provide detailed descriptions of each memory component and its subcomponents
3. Include information about memory commands and automatic memory management
4. Connect the new page to existing documentation

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding more sophisticated diagrams showing memory interactions
2. Potentially create example memory file templates for each memory type
3. Add more detailed information about memory retrieval mechanisms
4. Consider documenting tools for working with the memory system

## Code/Systems Created

- Created a new documentation page with a comprehensive knowledge system map
- Updated the main documentation page with a link to the new knowledge system map
- Implemented a visual representation of the memory architecture using React components
