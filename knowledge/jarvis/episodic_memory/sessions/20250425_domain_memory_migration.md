# Memory System Migration Session

**Date:** April 25, 2025  
**Type:** System Architecture Migration  
**Participants:** User & Jarvis

## Summary
Successfully migrated Jarvis's memory system from a flat type-based structure to a domain-based organization. This new structure puts domains at the top level, with each domain containing the four cognitive memory types.

## Key Changes
1. Created domain-based memory structure with folders for jarvis, project1, project2, and project3
2. Each domain contains semantic_memory, episodic_memory, procedural_memory, and structured_memory
3. Migrated all existing content from the flat structure to the jarvis domain
4. Updated documentation in index.md and created domain README files
5. Added documentation standard based on Evolution Roadmap page design
6. Preserved migration procedure in procedural memory

## Benefits
- Better organization for multiple projects
- Clearer context separation between domains
- Maintained cognitive memory model within each domain
- More scalable structure for future expansion
- Consistent memory access patterns regardless of domain

## Technical Details
The migration was performed using standard file system operations. A detailed procedure was documented in `domains/jarvis/procedural_memory/migration/memory_migration_procedure.md` for reference.
